<b>Philosopher 42 Project</b>
Description
The Philosopher 42 Project is an implementation of the Dining Philosophers Problem, a classic concurrency problem in computer science. This project demonstrates how multiple philosophers (processes/threads) can share a limited number of resources (forks) without leading to deadlock or starvation.

Inspired by problem-solving methodologies, this project is a practical exploration of synchronization, deadlock avoidance, and resource management in distributed systems.
